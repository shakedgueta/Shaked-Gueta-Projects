# Basic SQL Project – Sales Database Management

## Project Goal
Design and build a structured relational database to manage product sales and customer information for a company.

## Project Description

This project is divided into two main parts:

### Part A – Database Creation  
- Create a new database named `Sales`  
- Design and implement multiple tables using SQL DDL commands  
- Define appropriate data types, **Primary Keys**, **Foreign Keys**, and **NOT NULL** constraints  
- The table structure follows an ERD schema provided in class

### Part B – Data Insertion  
- Populate the new database tables with real data  
- Import data from the **AdventureWorks** sample database  
- Ensure data integrity and relationships between tables are preserved

## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL DDL and DML  
- Relational schema design  
- Use of constraints and normalization  
- Working with real-world datasets (AdventureWorks)  
- Writing complex queries for business insights

The project was developed as part of an academic SQL course. All scripts were tested on Microsoft SQL Server.
